Multi-Tier Architecture on AWS using Terraform
Deploy a scalable and resilient multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project allows us to deploy a highly available, scalable, and secure multi-tier architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. 

The architecture consists of the following three tiers:

Web Tier: This tier handles incoming user requests and can be horizontally scaled for increased capacity. It typically includes web servers and a load balancer for distributing traffic.

Application Tier: Application servers run our business logic and interact with the database tier. They can also be horizontally scaled to meet demand.

Database Tier: The database stores and manages our application data. In this architecture, we use Amazon RDS for a managed database service.

âœ¨ Features

High Availability: The architecture is designed for fault tolerance and redundancy.
Scalability: Easily scale the web and application tiers to handle varying workloads.
Security: Security groups and network ACLs are configured to ensure a secure environment.

ðŸŒŸ Web Tier

The Web Tier is the entry point for incoming user requests. It typically includes:

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers.
Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.
Security Groups: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers.
